# Digital watermarking

The aim of this project is to develop an invisible and robust image watermark in the domain of Fourier. It will be thus question to consider the process of elaboration of a watermark and its incorporation into the image. The choice of the parameters involved in this process will therefore have its importance. Finally, a decoding step will be necessary in order to identify the presence of the watermark.
